## STEPS

# The functionality is almost the same that "master-Redux-DashBoard"

1.  I only made some adjustment in order to show the single student chart in a single page, the earlier version, the student data was displayed next to students lists

2.  I Look to long hours of bootstrap tutorial.

3.  Creating the table was a pain in the ass coz I need to change the structure. For that I have to map only in the body of the table, if I map in the parent component, it creates me a table for every element which is not cool at all!
