# STEPS:

1. Create index.html.
   1.1 Change the title
   1.2 Create <h1> inside the body

2. Isntall last version of bootstrap.
   2.1 - Copy the npm version form this website:
   https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/

2.2 Copy the CDN link

2.3 index.html: Past the link on the HEAD (lin 8 - 12)

2.4 index.html. Cut the script src and paste it in the body, just after the <h1>

N: We could also install the package in the terminal:
npm install bootstrap@5.2.2

3. Create a "assets" folder to include some images later on.
   I can get the images from the gitHub for this lesson.
