# Gettting starting

1. Create file "master-Redux-DashBoard"

2. Copy files in "master-Redux-DashBoard" from "React-Redux_Setup-app"

3. npm install

4. Copy the store (redux) from "Redux-DashBoard-Subjects".

# Check README where is explained how I convert the SCV file (excel) into a JS file. This storeLice is very based, only store the date from output.js. I have not build yet the reducers!

5. src/components/: Copy "output.js". This contains the data

6. From Redux-SongSaver-app, Copy in src/:

- index.js
- NavBar.js
- logo.jpg

7. src/: Create the 3 pages (main components):

- Home.js
- SingleStudent.js
- SliceDicingData.js

N: I had no fucking clue of the arquitecture at the beguinning. I was adapting to the requiresment of the exercise

8. src/NavBar.js:
   Make the changes so the 3 main components will be displayed

9. src/App.js
   MAke the changes to adapt to the new components
